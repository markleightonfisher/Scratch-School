Excellent, good to see the school example progress.

Here are some team conventions I'd like to see you follow:

    table names are singular, which you're already doing
    never give a relationship the same name as a column (it's valid but very confusing)
    name foreign keys same as primary keys of foreign table
        prefix with an adjective if duplicates
        e.g. we have standard create_user_id and last_mod_user_id columns
    primary keys are prefixed with table name, e.g. assignment_id
    auto incrementing PKs should be of type serial (PostgreSQL will do the rest)
    use timestamp with time zone for timestamps (still gets stored as UTC but seeing the TZ is nice)
    define relationships using a HASH
        Not for performance reasons, it's just more explicit and easier to understand
        e.g. has_many student_assignments ... { 'foreign.assignment_id' => 'self.assignment_id' }
