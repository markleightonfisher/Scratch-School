Hi Mark,

I would like to be sure you are familiar with some specific techniques in DBIx::Class.  So I'd like to see you build out a simple schema and write some examples to do the following.

    Start a new project with a DBIx::Class schema named School::Schema
    Add some result source classes:
        School::Schema::Result::Student
        School::Schema::Result::Class
        School::Schema::Result::StudentClass
        School::Schema::Result::Assignment
        School::Schema::Result::Grade
    Add some fields that make sense (use your imagination :)
    Add some relationships that make sense, for example:
        Student has_many student_classes
        Student many_to_many classes
        Student has_many grades
        Assignment belongs_to class
        Assignment has_many grades
        Grade belongs_to assignment
        Grade belongs_to student
        Class has_many assignments
        Class many_to_many students
    Do a simple deploy to a postgres db with $schema->deploy
    Use the $schema->resultset()->populate() method to add data to the schema
        Explain difference between populate in list and void context
        Turn on tracing for DBIx::Class to watch the queries being run
    Fetch data that was populated
        Experiment with fetching students
        Prefetch their grades
        Prefetch their grades and assignment the grade is from
        Prefetch their grades and assignment the grade is from and class the assignment is from

So have some fun working on this.  Build it up in a git repo so you can share it and I can see what you're building.  Again, just use your imagination to make this up.  I just want to get a sample Schema built up so you are able to try out some techniques.
